SDSLabs Portfolio
=================

This is a portfolio of various products made by SDSLabs. It will also include
our achievements (such as contests won) and some details about the members involved
in the specific item.

#Development
This repository uses Jekyll for storing data as markdown items that are easily
edited/created. All items will be created as posts in jekyll, and will be available
at a custom URL of their own as well.

The Home Page will include all the stories in thumbnails, optionally filtered by
type of story.
