SDSLabs Portfolio
=================

This is a portfolio of various products made by SDSLabs. It will also include
our achievements (such as contests won) and some details about the members involved
in the specific item.

#Development
This repository uses Jekyll for storing data as markdown items that are easily
edited/created. All items will be created as posts in jekyll, and will be available
at a custom URL of their own as well.

The Home Page will include all the stories in thumbnails, optionally filtered by
type of story.

A direct post page (muzi.html) will only show the direct popup with nothing in bg.

This repo uses a lot of jekyll magic to make sure everything is clean and simple.

#Adding a new Tile
To add a new post, just create a new post under `_posts/YEAR-MONTH-DATE-TITLE.md`
format. Make sure you add the images, excerpt (shown on hover), and a single word
(lowercase) category. A small title and layout: post is also needed.

Before committing run the script for generating thumbnails as well (#todo)
